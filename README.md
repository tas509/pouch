# PouchDB and jQuery

This project is a beginner's attempt to learn how to make PouchDB and jQuery work together, eventually into an installable PWA.

Ideally, I'd like to keep the code as simple as possible and use no "frameworks", no node.js, no complicated anything. The reason being, this eventually might become a way for me to teach how to "make an app" to students, that doesn't involve (much) hosting, or database servers, CORS issues,  or all that crap. 

Ideally, I'd like this "app" to have a rough concept of backend (albeit without a model), and a frontend (albeit without views), not only to keep it tidy, and somewhat logical, and also maybe make it "adaptable", so that a different CRUD app might be created by copying this, editing the forms, and {doc} building bits, but the reset would still work (attachments, search etc ).


I'm also experimenting with Sqlite3 and Flask in this [flaskapp](https://github.com/tas509/flaskapp) - for similar reasons. I'm hoping (and may be wrong) but maybe Flask/Sqlite3 and Cordova could whip up an "app" of sorts. Who knows, let's find out.

Ideally, with that app, I'd like to have an opportunity to learn about sql database creation, and how simple it can be, and have enough fleshed out so that again, making a few changes would help someone (or me probably) hobble something together.

Anyway, **the whole point of both**, is that annoyingly, for me at least, most demos are either too complete (and use React or something) or just fragments and don't show the line of code in the context of a working system of sorts.
